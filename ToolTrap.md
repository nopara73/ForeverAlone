Excerpt form the book: [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning)  

There has been much written on the role of tools, formal models,
modeling, and so on, in software development. Many people claim
that UML and model-driven architecture (MDA) are the future, just
as many people claimed that RUP and CMM process models were
the salvation of the industry.  

But as with all silver-bullet scenarios, people soon found out that
it just ain’t that easy. Although these tools and models have their
place and can be useful in the right environments, none of them
has become the hoped-for universal panacea. Worse yet, the misapplication
of these approaches has probably done far more damage
than good.  

Interestingly enough, the nursing profession
had similar problems with regard to
the use of tools and formal models. They
had fallen into the same trap that many
architects and designers fall for: forgetting that **the model is a tool, not a mirror.**  

Rules cannot tell you the most relevant activities to perform in a
given situation or the correct path to take. They are at best “training
wheels”—helpful to get started but limiting and actively detrimental
to performance later.  

Dr. Deborah Gordon contributed a chapter to Benner’s book, in
which she outlines some of the dangers of overreliance on formal
models for the nursing profession. I’ve reinterpreted her sentiments
with the particulars of our profession, but even the original version
will sound pretty familiar to you.  

***

**Confusing the model with reality**  
A model is not reality, but it’s easy to confuse the two.
There’s the old story of the young project manager, where his
senior programmer announced she was pregnant and going to
deliver during the project, and he protested that this “wasn’t
on the project plan.”  

**Devaluing traits that cannot be formalized**  
Good problem-solving skills are critical to our jobs, but problem
solving is a very hard thing to formalize. For instance,
how long can you just sit and think about a problem? Ten
minutes? A day? A week? You can’t put creativity and invention
on a time clock, and you can’t prescribe a particular technique
or set of techniques. Even though you want these traits on your team, you may find that management will stop valuing
them simply because they cannot be formalized.  

**Legislating behavior that contradicts individual autonomy**  
You don’t want a bunch of monkeys banging on typewriters
to churn out code. You want thinking, responsible developers.
Overreliance on formal models will tend to reward herd
behavior and devalue individual creativity.  

**Alienating experienced practitioners in favor of novices**
This is a particularly dangerous side effect. By targeting your
methodology to novices, you will create a poor working environment
for the experienced team members, and they’ll simply
leave your team and/or organization.  

**Spelling out too much detail**  
Spelling out the particulars in too much detail can be overwhelming.
This leads to a problem called infinite regress: as
soon as you make one set of assumptions explicit, you’ve
exposed the next level of assumptions that you must now
address. And so on, and so on.  

**Oversimplification of complex situations**  
Early proponents of the Rational Unified Process (and some
recent ones) cling to the notion that all you have to do is “just
follow the process.” Some advocates of Extreme Programming
insist all you need to do is “just follow these twelve—no wait,
maybe thirteen—practices” and everything will work out. Neither
camp is correct. Every project, every situation, is more
complex than that. Any time someone starts a sentence with
“All you need to do is...” or “Just do this...,” the odds are they
are wrong.  

**Demand for excessive conformity**  
The same standard may not always apply equally in all situations.
What worked great on your last project may be a disaster
on this one. If Bob and Alice are hugely productive with
Eclipse, it might wreck Carol and Ted. They prefer IntelliJ or
TextMate or vi.  

**Insensitivity to contextual nuances**
Formal methods are geared to the typical, not the particular.
But when does the “typical” really ever happen? Context
is critical to expert performance, and formal methods tend
to lose any nuances of context in their formulations (they
have to; otherwise, it would take thousands of pages just to
describe how to get coffee in the morning).  

**Confusion between following rules and exercising judgment**  
When is it OK to break the rules? All the time? Never? Somewhere
in between? How do you know?  

**Mystification**
Speech becomes so sloganized that it becomes trivial and
eventually loses meaning entirely (for example, “We’re a
customer-focused organization!”). Agile methods are fast losing
effectiveness because of this very problem.  

***

Formal methods have other advantages and uses but are not helpful
in achieving these goals. Although it may be advantageous
to establish baseline rules for the lower skill levels, even then
rules are no substitute for judgment. As ability to judge increases,
reliance on rules must be relaxed—along with any rigid institutional
enforcement.  
Don’t succumb to the false authority of a tool or a model. There is
no substitute for thinking.
