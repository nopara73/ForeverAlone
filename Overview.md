> [The Agile Unified Process (AUP)](http://www.ambysoft.com/unifiedprocess/agileUP.html#Overview) is a simplified version of the Rational Unified Process (RUP). It describes a simple, easy to understand approach to developing business application software using agile techniques and concepts yet still remaining true to the RUP.  

I have stolen the skeleton of AUP. This crime was an organic process, I had been using AUP for so long, at so many projects that one day I realized I am no longer doing it anymore. This is how Forever Alone Programming borned.

This graph depicts the simplified lifecycle of AUP.  
Start your software at the Inception phase and "finish" it with the Transition phase. During each and every phase pay sufficent attention to the other dimension: Modelling, Implementation, Testing... The amount of attention you ideally pay on these is indicated by the colored lines of the graph.  
  
## [Phases](http://www.ambysoft.com/unifiedprocess/agileUP.html#Serial)
1. [Inception](https://github.com/nopara73/ForeverAloneProgramming/blob/master/Inception.md): The goal is to identify the initial scope of the project.
2. [Elaboration](https://github.com/nopara73/ForeverAloneProgramming/blob/master/Elaboration.md): The goal is to ensure that the team can actually develop a system that satisfies the requirements.
3. [Construction](https://github.com/nopara73/ForeverAloneProgramming/blob/master/Construction.md): The goal is to build working software.
4. [Transition](https://github.com/nopara73/ForeverAloneProgramming/blob/master/Transition.md): The goal is to validate and deploy your system into your production environment.
